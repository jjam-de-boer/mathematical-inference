Stable facade for external-theorem interfaces and their finite transports.

`Certificates` defines the shared certificate shapes, while `Correspondence`
states the graph-indexed `PublishedSoundness` and `PublishedCompleteness`
boundaries.  These records make theorem ownership explicit: soundness is
inhabited constructively below, while importing this facade still does not
assume completeness as an axiom.

`FiniteSource` supplies an independently executable finite-table semantics,
proves preservation into the intrinsic semantics, and exposes source-level
adapters.  `DSeparationCorrectness` connects the finite ancestry and moral
reachability searches to active-path separation.

`Soundness` develops the graph-independent probability algebra and the finite
latent factorization needed by the three do-calculus rules.  The factorized
path arguments now construct every rule partition directly from projected
graph compatibility, and `ObservedGraph.publishedSoundness` assembles those
partitions with d-separation correctness into the complete published record.
The older hypothesis-bearing adapters remain useful as documented local
interfaces, but they are no longer obligations of the public theorem.

`Completeness` develops the executable ID side for the positive model class:
successful special cases compile to supported certificates, the two terminal
success-trace constructors compile to formula-aligned packages, finite search
extracts hedge data from checked failures, and shared-switch hedge models
provide positive counterexamples for the covered queries.  `HedgePositive`
uses finite marginalization to reduce full-query separation to one suitable
outcome coordinate.  Its strongest localized mix selects a directed-and-
bidirected action-parent bow and reads only that bow's pair-root.  This removes
parent-uniqueness, odd-parity, identical-neighbourhood assumptions, and all
restrictions on the pivot's other outgoing edges without choosing a family of
pointwise equivalences.  A complete `PublishedCompleteness`
inhabitant still needs structural compilation of arbitrary successful traces
and a positive countermodel for an arbitrary hedge.  `ChainCompilation`
supplies the probability-algebra foundation of that compiler: an exact,
support-carrying observational chain certificate on any finite host, including
hosts with topological gaps.  It does not identify a recursive ID input with
the host's observational marginal.  The front-door regression in
`Thesis.Examples.IdentificationRegression` proves that a legacy successful
engine formula is incorrect in a positive compatible model: its exact-output
success compiler cannot exist.  A total, action-free engine result is not
itself a certificate.
`IdentificationKernel` now implements the replacement recursion with
current-input prefix quotients, uncut ancestral pruning, and the separate
action-augmentation branch.  `KernelIdentification` proves a quadratic
fuel bound for every invocation of that replacement.  Compilation of its
successful branches and lifting its failures to the original-query hedge
countermodel remain completeness obligations, rather than being inferred
from the old engine's trace library.
`HedgeOutcomeFlow`
proves exact finite support formulas for the general routed hedge models and
packages an unrestricted original-query counterexample when readout routing
does not re-enter `large \ small`; removing that geometric hypothesis and preserving
strict positivity remain the countermodel obligations.  `IdentificationInduction`
supplies exact success, failure, and unfinished traces so this work can proceed
by one lemma per recursive ID branch rather than by enumerating deeper
branch-name stacks.  `CompletenessAssembly` is the one-way integration layer:
it imports the completed soundness theorem without creating a dependency from
`Completeness` back to `Soundness`.  Its support-sensitive Bayes constructor
now combines arbitrary joint certificates into a conditional certificate,
requiring denominator positivity only where the source conditional is defined.

The remaining modules transport ordinary, modal, learning, hidden-DAG, and
counterfactual certificates.  The project-wide axiom audit checks declarations
reachable through this facade and permits only the foundational `propext` and
`Quot.sound` axioms.
