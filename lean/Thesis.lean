Top-level convenience import for the thesis formalisation.

For a smaller dependency footprint, client developments should normally import
one stable facade directly: `Thesis.Probability`, `Thesis.Causality`, or
`Thesis.CausalTransport`.  This module additionally imports the executable
tenure-track example and checked identification regressions, so it is the
appropriate root for the complete thesis build and the axiom audit.
The current-input compilation regressions additionally exercise supported
certificates on a gapped host, a nonempty external action, and an empty
observed signature.  Component-extraction regressions additionally exercise
graph-derived action deletion and exchange, a genuinely recursive extracted
input, and the terminal complementary marginal.  The recursive branch
regression composes nonempty action augmentation, containing-component
action reindexing, and uncut ancestral pruning, and checks its certificate
throughout the positive compatible model class.
Product-regrouping regressions additionally exercise interleaving components,
duplicate factors, certificate substitution, and an empty outer partition;
their algebra does not impose observational positivity.
The complete component-product regression additionally checks the actual
replacement-engine output for a nonempty-action, two-component query and
its denotation throughout the positive compatible model class.
Structural success-compilation regressions now construct those certificates
automatically from the actual engine success equations, including front-door,
nonempty augmentation, a recursive gapped host with external actions, empty
outcomes, and the zero-node signature.  No hand-supplied child certificate is
needed by the structural compiler.
Structural failure-extraction regressions exercise immediate failure with a
proper incoming-cut ancestry, uncut pruning, nonempty action augmentation,
containing-component restriction, and a failed product factor.  They check
hedges for the original queries with exact terminal forest coordinates, and
also cover a recursive host with external actions and an arbitrary current term.
Private-noise regressions check exact finite parity bias, unequal input
denominators, deterministic input support, the zero-noise boundary, and erasure
of separation by fair noise.  A three-value carrier checks support beyond the
two parity labels, and an actual extracted hedge checks its root-signal gap
after any finite biased-noise count.  This is not yet original-outcome routing.
